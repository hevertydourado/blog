# About Me

Hi! I'm Heverty Buges, driven by a deep passion for protecting the digital world. Since I first got involved in cybersecurity, I discovered that my true calling is helping to keep people and companies safe in the online environment.

Over the years, I've developed an insatiable curiosity about how things work and, more importantly, how they can be protected. I love diving into the details, uncovering hidden vulnerabilities, and finding the best solutions to keep them out of reach of threats.

My journey into cybersecurity started with simple curiosity, but it quickly turned into a lifelong mission. Today, I dedicate myself to constantly learning and applying that knowledge to protect data and systems. Whether it's configuring a SIEM, conducting in-depth security analysis, or helping a team respond to an incident, I feel a great sense of satisfaction knowing that I'm contributing to a safer digital environment.

When I'm not exploring new ways to defend against cyber threats, you can find me experimenting with new technologies, coding in Python, or simply sharing knowledge with the community. I believe that digital security is a collective effort, and each of us has a role to play.

I'm always open to new ideas, challenging projects, and collaborations that can make a difference. If you share this passion for cybersecurity, let's connect!

**Let's protect the digital future together.**
